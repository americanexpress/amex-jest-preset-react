amex-jest-preset-react
========

An opinionated [Jest preset](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#preset-string) for React modules

For non-React modules use [amex-jest-preset](https://github.com/americanexpress/amex-jest-preset)

## Configurations

Extends [amex-jest-preset](https://github.com/americanexpress/amex-jest-preset) and adds the following configurations that are specific to testing React modules:

- [snapshotSerializers](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#snapshotserializers-array-string) tells Jest to use [enzyme-to-json's](https://github.com/adriantoine/enzyme-to-json) serializer

- [moduleNameMapper](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#modulenamemapper-object-string-string) tells Jest to treat CSS modules as identity objects

## Usage

1. Install:
```bash
npm install --save-dev amex-jest-preset-react
```
2. And in your package.json:
```json
...
"jest": {
    "preset": "amex-jest-preset-react"
}
...
```
And... that's it! You now have all the boilerplate Jest configurations set up for you! Running `jest` from your `npm test` script will use all these configurations!

**Note:** You can (but better have a good reason to) override these configurations by [providing your own](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html) `jest` configuration
