## ‚ú® Features

* Base for Jest's configuration for React modules

## ü§π‚Äç Usage

1. Install:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev amex-jest-preset-react
    ```

2. And in your [Jest configuration][]:

    ```json
    {
      "preset": "amex-jest-preset-react"
    }
   ```

And... that's it! You now have all the boilerplate Jest configurations set up for you! Running `jest` from your `npm test` script will use all these configurations!

## üéõÔ∏è API

### Extending the preset provided configuration

You can add on and/or override any values provided in this preset as you wish in your [Jest configuration][].

It should be noted that if overriding the `setupFilesAfterEnv` option you may want to extend off of the [setup file provided by amex-jest-preset-react](./jest-setup.js) in order to preserve that files' content. Otherwise you will lose anything we provide for you in [there](./jest-setup.js). Do so as follows:

```javascript
// in custom-jest-setup.js
require('amex-jest-preset-react/jest-setup');

// your own custom setup
```

### Configurations

Extends [amex-jest-preset](https://github.com/americanexpress/amex-jest-preset) and adds the following configurations that are specific to testing React modules:

- [testEnvironment](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#testenvironment-string) tells Jest to use `jsdom` test environment as it is often used while testing React components ([amex-jest-preset](https://github.com/americanexpress/amex-jest-preset) sets `testEnvironment` to `node`)

- [moduleNameMapper](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#modulenamemapper-object-string-string) tells Jest to treat CSS modules as identity objects

- [setupFilesAfterEnv](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#setupfilesafterenv-array) is where we setup [enzyme with enzyme-adapter-react-16](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/installation/react-16.html)

- [snapshotSerializers](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#snapshotserializers-array-string) tells Jest to use [enzyme-to-json's](https://github.com/adriantoine/enzyme-to-json) serializer

### Compatibility

This package is compatible only with React 16+.
